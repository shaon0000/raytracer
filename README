Assignment: A5

The final executable was compiled on this machine: gl07

How to invoke my program: 
./rt <script> <thread number> <DOF samples>

Set DOF_samples to 0 to prevent any Depth of Field effects. Set it higher for
more quality. The recommended amount is 50.

NOTE: If no DOF or thread_number is supplied, default are assumed. 
thread_number default: 1
DOF_samples: 0

Objectives:
[x] Create two new primitives
[x] soft shadows
[x] reflection and refraction
[x] depth of field focus
[x] texture mapping
[x] bump mapping
[x] multi-threading support
[x] Area lights with spotlight effect
[ ] photon mapping
[ ] coffee table scene

I was unable to get photon mapping working and did not have enough time to create
the coffee table image.
